# Workshop materials  
Please consider doing the following in preparation for the workshop.  

Note: Some of the installations such as shinyserver can only be done on linux operating system.

### Installations  

1. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)    
2. [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and create a [github](https://github.com/) account in case you don't have one.    
3. [shinyserver](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-shiny-server-on-ubuntu-20-04)   

### Django REST API   
The [Django_notes](https://github.com/oyogo/Django_notes) repo on my github account has some introdutory notes on how to set up django rest api. Feel free to check other articles/materials in case you don't find them clear/helpful - the goal is to have the api up and running on your laptop.  

### Bash script
* The *test_bashscript.sh* in this repo is a simple test bash script that performs an arithmetic calculation for testing - we will later edit it to do a git pull. Download it to your laptop and put it in the */srv/shiny-server/* repo (the default installation location of shinyserver).   
    
* Remember to change the path on the second line accordingly.  

### In case you get time...   

* Install shiny package.  
* Create a simple shiny application.  
* Push the code to a github repository.

# Workshop materials  
Please consider doing the following in preparation for the workshop.  

Note: Some of the softwares such as shinyserver can only be installed on unix(linux/mac) operating systems.

### Installations  

1. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)    
2. [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and create a [github](https://github.com/) account in case you don't have one.    
3. [shinyserver](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-shiny-server-on-ubuntu-20-04)   

### Django REST API   
The [Django_notes](https://github.com/oyogo/Django_notes) on my account has some introdutory notes on how to set up django rest api. Feel free to check other articles/materials in case you don't find them clear/helpful - the goal is to have the api up and running on your laptop.  

### bash script
* The [test_bashscript.sh](https://github.com/oyogo/workshops_for_ukraine) is a simple test bash script that performs an arithmetic calculation. 
Keeping it simple for a start - we will later edit it to do a git pull.    
* Remember to change the path on the second line accordingly.
